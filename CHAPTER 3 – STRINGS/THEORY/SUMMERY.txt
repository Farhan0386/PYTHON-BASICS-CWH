# STRING : it is datatype in python . it is enclosed by quotes 
 a ='harry' # Single quoted string      
 b = "harry" # Double quoted string     
 c = '''harry'''  # Triple quoted string

#STRING SLICING : it means we can get spacific of part of string by slicing.
 ex =>  name=farhan  => length =6
           ||||||
           012345  these are position of alphabats in my name as f gets 0 then a gets 1 .... and n gets 5 .
           s1=name[index start:index end]
           s1[0:3] return far
           s1[1:3] return ar
#SLICING WITH SKIP VALUE :  word = "amazing"
                            word[1:6:2] this return mzn it starts from index 1 to 6 it starts from m then jump that letter after skiping 2 letters means m is first and a is second then it jumps to z.
                            Other advanced slicing techniques:  word[ :7] returns amazing because it means [0:7]
                                                                word[0: ] return  amazing beacuse it means [0:7] 


#STRING FUNCTIONS :  str='farhan'

                    1 print(len(str))              outputs : 6 => len () function – This function returns the length of the strings. 
                    2 print(str.endswitch('han'))  outputs : True  => String.endswith('han') – This function_ tells whether the variable string ends with the string "rry" or not. 
                    3 print(str.count('r'))        outputs : 1  =>  string.count("c") – counts the total number of occurrences of any character.
                    4 print(str.capitalize())      outputs : Farhan => it will capitalize the first letter of string
                    5 print(str.find('rha'))       outputs : 2 => string.find(word) – This function friends a word and returns the index of first occurrence of that word in the string. 
                    6 print(str.replace('r','a'))  outputs : faahan =>  string.replace (old word, new word ) – This function replace the old word with new word in the entire string


#ESCAPE SEQUENCE CHARACTERS : example :1 \n for to print in to new line remaing string after \n
                                       2 \t for tab space between to words in string
                                       3 \' for single quote after a letter
                                       4 \\ for backslash in string
